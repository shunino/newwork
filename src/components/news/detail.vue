          From the bar chart given above, we can observe that the way of payment in a certain city
          of China has experienced a dramatic change in the 3 years from 2015 to 2017. The share of way of payment
          in cash declined dramatically from 80% in 2015 to 30% in 2017, while taking a look at the statistics
          of that in wechat and Alipay ,we can see that it ascended gradually from 20% in 2015 to the maximum at 70% in 2017.

          What exactly contributes to this phenomenon? Reasons can be listed as follows: the authorities in developing countries have issued some
          relevant policies to protect and promote the development of the new technology,as a result of which is emerging ways of
          payment.Moreover, with increasing enconomics of our country,people in mounting numbers can afford to buy daily commodities which
          were once deemed impossible. What’s more, as regards their safety, it is under control in organization involved.

          The trend that new ways of payment will occupy the increasing part of our market will remain in the coming years.
          To keep the market in a splendid state, it is imperative and essential for the authorities concerned to take proper actions to
          regulate the trading operation and keep a close watch on the consumer market.
